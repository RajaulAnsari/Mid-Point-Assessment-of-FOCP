# Fundamental of Computer Programming

## Assignment: Task 7

### Task

Write a program that simulates the checkout process in a
small store. The program should store a list of items in
stock, along with the prices. The user should be able to
pick an item, and have that added to some sort of basket. Once
done, the program should display a list of items purchased and the total
amount due.
Exactly how the data is stored is up to you - it is part of the task. The
dialogue does not need to be especially neat, but might look something like
this.

- Your code look like this:
```
Welcome to the Shop!
Currently in stock: apple (35p) - banana (18p) - orange (26p)
Pick an Item, or Enter to Checkout.
Choice --> apple
Item added.
Choice --> cheese
No such item. Try again.
Choice --> orange
Item added.
Choice --> apple
Item added.
Choice -->
Thank you. You have purchased apple - orange - apple at a cost of 96p.

```

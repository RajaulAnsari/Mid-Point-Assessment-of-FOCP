# Fundamental of Computer Programming

## Assignment: Task 6

### Task

A program is required that can calculate monthly rainfall
statistics. It should work, as shown below, by prompting
the user to enter the observed monthly rainfall figure for
each month. It should then display the maximum and minimum
rainfalls, the average, and standard deviation. If the same maximum or
minimum is observed in two months the program should simply report the
earliest one in the year.
Note: You can find the formula for standard deviation online, if you think you
need it.

- Your code look like this:
```
Enter rainfall for January: 123mm
Enter rainfall for February: 209mm
Enter rainfall for March: 220mm
Enter rainfall for April: 300mm
Enter rainfall for May: 250mm
Enter rainfall for June: 90mm
Enter rainfall for July: 75mm
Enter rainfall for August: 40mm
Enter rainfall for September: 201mm
Enter rainfall for October: 310mm
Enter rainfall for November: 315mm
Enter rainfall for December: 290mm

Max Rainfall: 315mm in November.
Min Rainfall: 40mm in August.

Average: 201.92mm.

Standard Deviation: 97.99mm.
```

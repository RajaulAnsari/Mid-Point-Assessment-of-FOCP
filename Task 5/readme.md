A program to play a simple card game is being developed. The first phase is
to program how to store the cards, the players' hands, and so on. Write a
program that creates a pack of cards, shuffles it, and deals 13 cards to each
of four players. The program should print the hands dealt, and then find
and display which player has the Ace of Spades. Two samples are below.

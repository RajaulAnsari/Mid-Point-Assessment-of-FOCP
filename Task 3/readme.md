## Assignment: Task 3

### Task

A secret society has agreed on a password before potential new members are
allowed into an online meeting. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a
password. If it is correct, the user may join the meeting, otherwise they should be
asked to re-enter. This should continue until the password is entered correctly. For
example (the password here is obvious from the last line!):

- Note: In the following, **bold text** indicates where a user is typing

Greetings! What is the password? **elderberry** <br>
Incorrect! You may try again.<br>
Greetings! What is the password? **hamster**<br>
Incorrect! You may try again.<br>
Greetings! What is the password? **parrot**<br>
Correct! You may enter.<br>
